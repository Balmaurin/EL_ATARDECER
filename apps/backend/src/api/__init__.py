"""
LEGACY REST API - DEPRECATED

This file contained legacy REST API routes that have been replaced by
the GraphQL Federation Gateway in apps/backend/federation_server.py

All API functionality is now served through GraphQL at /graphql endpoint.
This file is kept for reference but is not used in the current deployment.

For GraphQL-only architecture purity, this legacy code should be removed.
